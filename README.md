To install Windows 11 on a UTM virtual machine (VM) on a Mac, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- **UTM** installed on your Mac (available on the [UTM website](https://utm.app/)).
- A **Windows 11 ISO** file. You can download it from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11).
- A **Mac** with enough resources (memory, storage) for running a VM.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. **Install UTM on Your Mac**
   - If you haven't installed UTM yet, go to the [UTM website](https://utm.app/), download the macOS version, and install it like any other macOS app.

#### 2. **Download Windows 11 ISO**
   - Download the latest Windows 11 ISO from Microsoft's official website:  
     [Windows 11 Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11).

#### 3. **Create a New Virtual Machine in UTM**
   - Open **UTM** on your Mac.
   - Click the **+** (plus) icon or **Create a New Virtual Machine**.
   - Select **Virtualize** (since UTM supports virtualization on M1/M2 Macs, but you can also choose **Emulate** if you are using an Intel Mac).
   - Select **Windows** as the operating system.

#### 4. **Configure the Virtual Machine**
   - **System Configuration:**
     - **Architecture**: Choose `x86_64` or `AArch64` based on whether you're running the VM on an Intel-based or ARM-based Mac.
     - **RAM**: Allocate sufficient RAM to the VM (4GB or more recommended for Windows 11).
     - **CPU**: Assign 2-4 CPUs, depending on your Macâ€™s specifications.
     - **Disk**: Create a new virtual disk for Windows (a minimum of 64GB is recommended for Windows 11).
   
   - **Boot Disk**: 
     - Select the **ISO file** for Windows 11 that you downloaded earlier. UTM will mount the ISO as a bootable CD-ROM.

#### 5. **Install Windows 11**
   - After configuring the VM, click **Save** to complete the VM creation process.
   - Select the created VM and click **Start**.
   - The VM will boot from the Windows 11 ISO file, and the Windows installation process will begin.

#### 6. **Follow the Windows 11 Installation Wizard**
   - The Windows installation process will begin. Follow the on-screen prompts:
     - Choose the language and region.
     - Select the **Custom Install** option.
     - Choose the **Virtual Hard Disk** you created earlier as the installation destination.
   - Let the installation complete. This may take a while depending on the performance of your Mac.

#### 7. **Post-Installation Steps**
   - Once Windows 11 is installed, the VM will reboot.
   - If UTM requires you to disconnect the ISO during the first reboot, do so, and it will boot into Windows 11.
   - Complete the Windows setup by entering your Microsoft account, choosing privacy settings, etc.

#### 8. **Install Guest Tools (Optional but Recommended)**
   - To improve performance (especially for mouse and display interaction), you may want to install UTM guest tools.
   - You may need to install QEMU drivers (UTM uses QEMU for virtualization) for better performance, but this depends on your Mac's architecture (Intel or Apple Silicon).

### Additional Tips:
- **Performance Considerations**: If you're running this on an Intel-based Mac, the experience should be smoother. For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2), UTM uses virtualization, which works well but can be slower than native Windows installations.
- **USB Devices**: You can attach USB devices (like a USB flash drive or external drive) to the virtual machine by configuring them in the UTM settings.

Now you should have Windows 11 running on your Mac using UTM!
